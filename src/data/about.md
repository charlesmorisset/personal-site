# Intro

I'm a Senior Lecturer in the School of Computing at Newcastle University. I joined the School in 2013, 
as a Senior Research Associate working with Aad van Moorsel and got my Lectureship in 2016 and 
Senior Lectureship in 2019. Since February 2020, I'm also Director of Postgraduate Studies for the School. 

# Research Projects

I have been involved with many research projects over the years.  I'm currently looking into two main 
topics: 
- Security of Smart Infrastructure, which includes with my involvement in the [PETRAS Centre](http://petras-iot.org), 
within which I'm leading two projects directly related to the security and privacy of smart buildings.
My main collaborators include Lilian Edwards (Law School), Luke Smith (Engineering), John Mace 
(Computing) and Rima Alaeedine (Computing). I've also done some with Carsten Maple (Warwick) within PETRAS on risk 
assessment for smart buildings. 
As part of this topic, I'm also involved in a Security work-package in the [Active Building Centre](http://activebuildingcentre.com),
working with Sara Walker (Engineering) and Ricardo Czekster (Computing), as well as 
John Clark (Sheffield) and Walter Bassage (Sheffield). Finally, I'm leading a Security work-package
in the [e4Future project](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/cesi/research/additionalresearch/e4futurev2g/), 
working with Myriam Neaimeh (Engineering) and Roberto Metere (Computing) on vehicle-to-grid systems.       
  
- Access Control, which was my PhD topic and on which I have had many collaborations over the years, 
including notably Nicola Zannone (TU Eindhoven) and Jason Crampton (Royal Holloway). Our initial 
[paper on PTaCL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.5767) has established a formal semantics for 
attribute-based access control (ABAC and introduced the problem of attribute hiding attacks (when an attacker
gains access control privilege by hiding some attributes). We have recently developed a [formal 
framework for the efficient evaluation of ABAC policies](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s42400-019-0024-0), 
with the collaboration of Tim Willemse. This framework uses Binary Decision Diagrams to 
make tractable the problem of evaluation policies with missing information.
